- **Quality**: High quality screenshots showing the actual applications

## Tips for Creating Screenshots:

1. Use a clean, professional browser window
2. Show the main features and UI of each application
3. Use consistent styling and presentation
4. For the monorepo project, you could show the customer portal interface
5. For the e-commerce project, show the main product page or dashboard

## Fallback:

If you don't have actual screenshots yet, you can:

1. Create mockups using Figma or similar tools
2. Use placeholder images temporarily
3. Take screenshots of similar projects you've worked on
4. Create wireframe-style representations

Remember to update the image paths in `constants.js` if you use different filenames.
